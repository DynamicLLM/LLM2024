## Abstract
In this paper, we discuss the existence of positive solutions for nonlocal q-integral boundary value problems of fractional q-difference equations. By applying the generalized Banach contraction principle, the monotone iterative method, and Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem, some existence results of positive solutions are obtained. In addition, some examples to illustrate our results are given.

## Introduction
Studies on q-difference equations date back to the early 20th century, with significant contributions from Jackson, Carmichael, and others. Fractional q-difference equations have gained importance due to their applications in science and engineering. This paper explores the existence of positive solutions for fractional q-difference boundary value problems using fixed point theorems.

## Preliminaries on q-Calculus and Lemmas

For \( q \in (0,1) \), the q-analogue of the power function is defined as:

```math
[a]_q = rac{1 - q^a}{1 - q}, \quad a \in \mathbb{R}.
```

The q-derivative of a function \( f \) is defined by:

```math
(D_q f)(x) = rac{f(qx) - f(x)}{(q - 1)x}, \quad (D_q f)(0) = \lim_{x 	o 0} (D_q f)(x).
```

The q-integral of \( f \) over \( [0, b] \) is given by:

```math
(I_q f)(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(s) d_qs = x(1 - q) \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(xq^k) q^k, \quad x \in [0, b].
```

## Main Results

We consider the fractional q-difference boundary value problem:

```math
(D^lpha_q u)(t) + f(t, u(t)) = 0, \quad 0 < t < 1, \quad 1 < lpha \leq 2.
```

With boundary conditions:

```math
u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = \mu I^eta_q u(\eta).
```

Using the Banach contraction principle, the monotone iterative method, and Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem, we establish the existence of positive solutions.

## Examples

### Example 1

Consider the boundary value problem:

```math
D^{1.5}_{0.5} u(t) + rac{e^t (1 + u)}{2(1 + e^t)} + t \sin^2 t + 4 = 0, \quad 0 < t < 1,
```

```math
u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0.25 I^{0.5}_{0.5} u(0.75).
```

Using our main theorems, we establish that this problem has a unique positive solution.
