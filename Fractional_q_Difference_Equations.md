## Abstract
In this paper, we discuss the existence of positive solutions for nonlocal q-integral boundary value problems of fractional q-difference equations. By applying the generalized Banach contraction principle, the monotone iterative method, and Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem, some existence results of positive solutions are obtained. In addition, some examples to illustrate our results are given.

## Introduction
Studies on q-difference equations date back to the early 20th century, with significant contributions from Jackson, Carmichael, and others. Fractional q-difference equations have gained importance due to their applications in science and engineering. This paper explores the existence of positive solutions for fractional q-difference boundary value problems using fixed point theorems.

## Preliminaries on q-Calculus and Lemmas
We recall key results in q-calculus, including q-derivatives, q-integrals, and key lemmas that will be used in our analysis.

## Main Results
We formulate a fractional q-difference boundary value problem and establish the existence of positive solutions using Banach's contraction principle, Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem, and the monotone iterative method.

## Examples
Several examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.
