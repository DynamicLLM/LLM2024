        "This program is an interactive math-solving tool that uses OpenAI's GPT to solve and verify mathematical problems. The program guides the user through the problem-solving process step by step and provides a verification mechanism. Users can select from suggested verification methods, such as graphical solutions, numerical solutions, substitution verification, or mathematical theorems, to confirm the accuracy of the solution. This makes the tool highly adaptable to various types of mathematical problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instructions to Use:\n",
        "1. Run the program and input a math question when prompted (e.g., \"how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23\").\n",
        "2. Review the list of suggested verification methods and select one or more by entering their corresponding numbers. If no method is selected, the program will default to \"Substitution verification.\"\n",
        "3. The program will call GPT to solve the question and display the solution steps along with the final answer.\n",
        "4. It will then verify the solution using the chosen methods and output the verification result.\n",
        "5. Review the verification result to confirm the solution's correctness.\n"
