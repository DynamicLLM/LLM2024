        "This program is an interactive math-solving tool designed to assist users in solving algebraic equations step-by-step with the help of OpenAI's GPT. Users begin by entering a math question and a verification method, such as substituting the solution back into the equation. The program uses GPT to generate a detailed explanation of the solution and then verifies the correctness of the final answer by calling GPT again. The output includes reasoning steps, the final answer, and the verification result. To use the program, ensure you have an OpenAI API key and a properly configured environment. Possible extensions include adding support for other types of math problems (e.g., calculus or geometry), enabling graphical representations of solutions, and providing feedback on user-defined verifying methods.\n",
